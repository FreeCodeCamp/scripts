# freeCodeCamp Scripts

This repository is where we keep our scripts for things like generating the mailing list and getting some statistics on our users.

## Setup

```
# install dependencies
yarn install

# create the .env file
cp sample.env .env
```

You will need to edit the `.env` file for your specific set up.

## Generating the mailing list

```sh
yarn mailing-list ./emails.csv
```

Happy Coding!
